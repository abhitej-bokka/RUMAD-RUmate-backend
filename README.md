# RUmate-backend - Rutgers Mobile App Development Club - Summer 2021


### Introduction

Rutgers Mobile App Development Club is a student-led Computer Science club invested in teaching the Rutgers community about Mobile App Development.
The club created a program known as the Accelertor which teaches a select amount of students the fundamentals of mobile app development - in my case JavaScript for the backend.
The backend track that I took allowed me to learn a lot about JavaScript, the frameworks like Node.js & Express.js that it offers, and how it can be used to create a wide variety of applications.

Wanting to dorm on campus at Rutgers, I hit a roadblock as to how I should get a roomate. I was struggling to find out where I can meet people and how I can easily reach out to people
that are also looking for a roomate. With many problems, comes many solutions, and a mobile app to find roomates would completely solve this issue. Now the pandemic gave me an extended break to find a roomate,
but instead, I and a few other members of the club used it to help create a roomate matching application. 

We decided to take over 15 multiple data points from users like
their sleep schedule, to their class year, to their preference of campuses. I eventually created an algorithm that would assign these attributes certain weights and compared them to other users to 
curate a queue of potential roomates for each user.

### Technologies

In this project we designed and implemented a non relational databse schema with MongoDB Atlas to support the operations of the backend. 
My other teammates worked on creating a user interface in Swift & Kotlin for iOS & Android respectively. 
I used JavaScript and implemented a REST API with Node.js & Express.js to manage the connectivity between the interface and server.
